# Football Match Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of historical football match data. The analysis covers various aspects of the matches, including goals scored, attendance, and other key metrics. The project utilizes Python libraries such as seaborn and matplotlib for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and presents the findings in multiple formats.

## Repository Contents

- **fifa_wc.pbix**: Power BI file containing visualizations and interactive analysis.
- **Fifa_World_Cup_Analysis.pptx**: A presentation summarizing the key findings of the analysis.
- **FIFA_world_cup_data.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset using seaborn and matplotlib.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Total number of matches
2. Average goals per match (home and away)
3. Highest and lowest attendance
4. Average attendance per match
5. Number of matches with zero goals
6. Distribution of goals scored (both home and away)
7. Year-over-year change in average goals
8. Year-over-year change in average attendance
9. Win rate for home teams
10. Frequency of matches decided by win conditions
11. Goals scored in the first half vs. second half
12. Distribution of match stages (e.g., group stage, knockout stage)
13. Most frequent referees and assistant referees
14. Number of matches per stadium and city
15. Average goals per team (home and away teams separately)
